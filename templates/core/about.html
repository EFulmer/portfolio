                My name is Eric and I‚Äôm a machine learning engineer. While I‚Äôve worked on the full stack/lifecycle of machine learning products, my true passion and expertise are in making sure ML products work ‚Äî and when they don‚Äôt, they tell you how and why they broke. Some people call this machine learning platform development, some call it machine learning operations.

                Outside of my 9-5, I am an organizer for NYC Python. I‚Äôve also helped to organize the yearly PyData NYC conferences since 2018.

                I own two cats who are siblings, and they show up in header images for a lot of my posts. While my goal is to provide you with useful information, I‚Äôm not above adding a relevant picture of them to get clicks. üòº
