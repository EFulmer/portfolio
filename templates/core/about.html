                My name is Eric and I‚Äôm a machine learning and DevOps engineer. While I‚Äôve worked on the full stack/lifecycle of machine learning products, my true passion and expertise are in making sure that programs work ‚Äî and when they don‚Äôt, they tell you how and why they broke. Some people call this platform development, some call it operations, some call it infrastructure. Since the terminology in this industry is still very much in flux, I choose to throw all those terms out there.

                Currently, I work as an engineer for <a class="text-blue-600 underline" href="https://penguinrandomhouse.com/">Penguin Random House</a>. This is about the coolest place I can envision myself working, since I'm a pretty active reader myself, and that's across any style or genre of book that you can imagine.

                Outside of my 9-5, I am an organizer for NYC Python. I‚Äôve also helped to organize the yearly PyData NYC conferences since 2018.

                I own two cats who are siblings, and they show up in header images for a lot of my posts. While my goal is to provide you with useful information, I‚Äôm not above adding a relevant picture of them to get clicks. üòº
