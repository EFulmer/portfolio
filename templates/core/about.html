<h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">About Me</h1>

<p class="mb-4">My name is Eric and I’m a machine learning engineer. While I’ve worked on the full stack/lifecycle of machine learning products, my true passion and expertise are in making sure ML products work — and when they don’t, they tell you how and why they broke. Some people call this machine learning platform development, some call it machine learning operations.</p>

<p class="mb-4">Outside of my 9-5, I am an organizer for NYC Python. I’ve also helped to organize the yearly PyData NYC conferences since 2018.</p>

<p class="mb-4">I own two cats who are siblings, and they show up in header images for a lot of my posts. While my goal is to provide you with useful information, I’m not above adding a relevant picture of them to get clicks. 😼</p>

<p class="mb-4">The best way to contact me is at <a class="text-blue-600 underline" href="mailto:efulmertech@gmail.com">efulmertech@gmail.com</a>. Inbox Zero may be an impossible dream, but I give it a good shot ☺️</p>
